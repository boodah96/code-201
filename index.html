            Hello, my name is Tala Emad. 
            <br>
            I have finished my bachelor's degree in computer science with an average of 86.9 from Zarqa University in Feb 2020. Recently I finished a penetration testing trainee at al-Hussain Technical University.
            <br>
            I have knowledge of multiple programming languages such as python, c#, and asp.net.
            <br>
            Having multiple skills, I’m a fast learner, a hard worker, a good leader, and efficient in my work.
            <br>
            My interest is in machine learning, image processing, and data science. That made me passionate about my graduation project.
            <br>
            Through my education period studying computer science,  I have spotlighted my studies in everything that included with information technology field.
            <br>
            I’m seeking to improve my experiences and achievements in both my professional path and my knowledge on each thing related to technology.
